# Solar Analysis Dashboard

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing solar radiation and weather data to identify optimal locations for solar panel installations. It provides insights into environmental factors and their impact on solar energy generation, supporting informed investment and deployment decisions.

## Data Description

The analysis incorporates a comprehensive dataset, including:

### Solar Measurements:
- **Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI):** Total sunlight received on a horizontal surface.
- **Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI):** Sunlight directly from the sun.
- **Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI):** Scattered sunlight reaching the surface.

### Panel Information:
- **Power Output:** Energy generated by solar panels.
- **Panel Temperature:** Heat levels affecting efficiency.

### Weather Data:
- **Ambient Temperature (Tamb):** Surrounding air temperature.
- **Relative Humidity (RH):** Moisture in the air.
- **Wind Speed (WS):** Speed of airflow.
- **Wind Direction (WD):** Orientation of wind.
- **Barometric Pressure (BP):** Atmospheric pressure.
- **Rainfall:** Precipitation measurements.

### Maintenance and Observations:
- **Panel Cleaning Records:** Dates and times of cleaning activities.
- **Notes:** Additional observations or metadata.

## Key Features
- Analyze time series trends for solar radiation, temperature, and weather patterns.
- Explore correlations between environmental factors and solar performance.
