## **Overview**
The analysis evaluates solar irradiance metrics:
- **Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)**
- **Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI)**
- **Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI)**
- **Ambient Temperature (Tamb)**

The objective is to recommend the most suitable region for solar energy projects by analyzing the data and visualizing the results.

## **Dataset Description**
The dataset contains solar irradiance and temperature data for Togo, Ser, and Benin. Key columns include:
- `Region`
- `GHI` (Global Horizontal Irradiance)
- `DNI` (Direct Normal Irradiance)
- `DHI` (Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance)
- `Tamb` (Temperature)

Data preprocessing steps:
1. Cleaning missing values.
2. Removing outliers.
3. Calculating summary statistics.

## **Key Metrics**
- **Mean GHI, DNI, DHI**: Indicates potential solar energy yield.
- **Standard Deviation**: Measures variability in solar conditions.
- **Temperature**: Impacts panel efficiency but is factored into the recommendation.

Results and Insights
The analysis concludes that:

Togo is the most favorable region for solar energy investments due to its superior solar irradiance metrics.
Ser offers more stable conditions but lower overall energy potential.
Benin serves as a balanced alternative but does not outperform Togo.
